# PairWiseAlignmentViz
A two-stream loop-and-bump visualization engine for the pairwise alignment of two sequences.

## Usage

```
python align_viz.py <input.fasta> <width> <height> <dpi> <output.svg>
```

The visualization depends on `matplotlib`. Install it in your active environment
before invoking the script (for example, `pip install matplotlib`).

Additional tuning parameters can be supplied through optional flags:

- `--min-gap-size`: gap length threshold separating loop glyphs from bird beaks (default: 10).
- `--block-size`: maximum block length evaluated as a whole before switching to the sliding window heuristic (default: 100).
- `--min-sequence-identity`: minimum identity required to avoid flagging a segment as weakly aligned (default: 0.7).
- `--window-size`: window length for scanning long regions for weak alignment (default: 20).

For troubleshooting, the tool also emits two TSV files alongside the requested
visualization output: `<output>_query_stream.tsv` and
`<output>_reference_stream.tsv`. Each row records the column index, global and
per-stream coordinates, local nucleotide positions, and feature flags so you can
inspect how loops, beaks, and weak regions are constructed.

The script accepts any pairwise alignment FASTA that contains exactly two sequences of equal length (including gap characters) such as MAFFT pairwise outputs.
